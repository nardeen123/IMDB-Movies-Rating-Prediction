This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates movie ratings by analyzing a range of features such as genre, director, cast, and other relevant metadata. By leveraging advanced regression techniques, the model will quantify the influence of various factors on a movie's success, providing valuable insights into how these elements contribute to audience perception and critical reception. The outcome of this project can aid filmmakers, studios, and streaming platforms in making data-driven decisions, optimizing content creation, and improving recommendation systems for users.
